# ComputerGraphics-Code-Bank

This repository contains a collection of **Computer Graphics programs implemented in C++** using the Turbo C++ environment (`graphics.h`). These were created as part of my B.Tech 4th Semester coursework and include essential algorithms and demonstrations.

## 📚 Programs Included

✅ **1. DDA Line Drawing**
- Draws a line between two points using the Digital Differential Analyzer algorithm.

✅ **2. Midpoint Circle Drawing**
- Draws a circle using the Midpoint Circle Algorithm and fills it.

✅ **3. Line Clipping**
- Implements line clipping logic inspired by the Cohen-Sutherland algorithm.

✅ **4. Polygon Clipping**
- Demonstrates visual polygon clipping within a rectangular window.

✅ **5. Smiley Face**
- Uses basic shapes to draw a smiley face.

✅ **6. Single Pixel and Pre-Specified Pattern**
- Shows how to plot pixels and draw primitive shapes.

✅ **7. 3D Bar**
- Draws a 3D bar using user-input transformation matrix elements.

## 🛠️ How to Compile and Run

### 💻 Turbo C++ (Windows)

1. **Install Turbo C++**  
   Make sure Turbo C++ is installed and `BGI` drivers are available at: C:\TURBOC3\BGI
2. **Open the IDE**
3. **Load the desired `.cpp` file**
4. **Compile and Run**

*Note:* These programs are designed for DOS-based Turbo C++. They **won’t run in modern compilers without adapting `graphics.h`.*

## ✨ Screenshots & Outputs

Each program folder contains:
- The `.cpp` source file
- A detailed `README.md` explaining:
- What the program does
- How it works
- Sample output
- Concepts demonstrated

## 🚀 Roadmap to Learn Computer Graphics

If you’re new to graphics programming, here’s a suggested learning path **(aligned with this repo):**

1️⃣ **Drawing Basics**
- `putpixel()`
- Drawing simple shapes (`circle()`, `rectangle()`, `line()`)

2️⃣ **Line Drawing Algorithms**
- DDA Line Drawing
- Bresenham's Line Algorithm (optional)

3️⃣ **Circle Drawing**
- Midpoint Circle Algorithm

4️⃣ **Polygon Clipping**
- Concept of clipping windows
- Cohen-Sutherland Algorithm logic

5️⃣ **3D Bar Rendering**
- Using `bar3d()` for 3D effects

6️⃣ **Combining Primitives**
- Drawing patterns, smiley faces, etc.
